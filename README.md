<h1 align="center">Hello, welcome to my GitHub.</h1>
<p align="justify">I'm a 22 years old brazilian computer science student at the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa in the state of Minas Gerais. Here, I'll be uploading projects I create during my graduation and some other coding in different programming areas. Currently I'm working more with Python, C and C++ languages on college projects and I also have experience with Azure Devops, CI/CD pipeline development, PowerShell, and APM with DataDog.
